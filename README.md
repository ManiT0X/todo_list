for the demo the Update/Delete at the main page are disabled , but you can go to <a href="https://216.pythonanywhere.com/create/example">/create/example<a> and you can add or edit 
the list for the main page  
when you add text and hit create you will be redirected to /create/<list_id> and every item created there will be added to the list .  
you can rename the list by clicking on the title  
you can mak a custom link just by typing anything you want after /create/, for example /create/ilovebacon .
